# StegoMailo

Stegomailo is a desktop application that allows users to create and send information via email while using 
the LSB steganography technique.

Users can use images or videos for hiding.

A user must set up an account with 3 factor authentication which consist of:

* Gmail
* QR Code
* PIN Code

The program was made to be as user friendly as possible using usable security and privacy techniques taught in the 
usable security and privacy course in Birzeit University.
